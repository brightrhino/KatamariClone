# KatamariClone
Katamari clone made in a week for a job interview using Unity. This is a new version that has no paid-for assets included. Everything you see and hear in the game is by me (except for Unity's Ethan model/animations).

I intend for this to be used for learning purposes. Do not use this project or any individual part of this project for any purpose that implies you made it yourself.
